<p class="intro">The intro text may be a lead-in to the passage of text, or it may just be used to create a visual distinction between the rest of the passage of text.</p>
<p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
